# h-transport-materials-dashboard

Finding material properties for hydrogen transport is often tedious as many different values can be found in literature.
The goal of this tool is to help scientists visualise material properties and compare them.

This web app relies on the hydrogen transport materials database [HTM](https://github.com/RemDelaporteMathurin/h-transport-materials).

:point_right: [The app!](https://htm-dashboard-uan5l4xr6a-od.a.run.app/)

:warning: Disclaimer: 
This web app is built for visualising properties.
For integrations in workflows and applications, we recommend using the python API [HTM](https://github.com/RemDelaporteMathurin/h-transport-materials)

## Features
- Quickly visualise the HTM database
- Add your own properties
- Compute mean curves of properties groups
- Extract data to JSON
- Extract python script (using the htm API)

## Stats
- How many times were the papers cited?
- When were the papers published?
- Repartition by material, isotope, author.
